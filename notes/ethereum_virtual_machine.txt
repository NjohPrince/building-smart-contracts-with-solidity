Ethereum Virtual Machine
- A runtime environment for smart contracts in ethereum.
- It is not only sandboxed but isolated, has no access to network file systems
- or any other processes.
- Smart contracts has limited access to other smart contracts.

The Ethereum protocol itself exists solely for the purpose of keeping the 
continuous, uninterrupted, and immutable operation of this special state 
machine; It's the environment in which all Ethereum accounts and smart 
contracts live. At any given block in the chain, Ethereum has one and only 
one 'canonical' state, and the EVM is what defines the rules for computing 
a new valid state from block to block.

Two types of accounts exist for smart contracts

External accounts
- Belongs to investors or to the holders
- The address of the contract is determined by a Public key

Contracts accounts
- Build and controlled by the developers
- Key determined when the contract is being created

When transfering ethers from one account to another we make use of the public
key, to add when we want to deal or bring up an account itself we work with the
nonce value, which is derived from the creator address and the number of
transactions sent from the address.
