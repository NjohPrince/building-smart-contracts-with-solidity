BLOCKCHAIN

- A blockchain in the most basic form is an audible database(a backend for storing information 
or transactions). It can be regarded as a database in which data can only be added on.

- It is a system in which a record of transactions made in bitcoin or another cryptocurrency are 
maintained across several computers that are linked in a peer-to-peer network.

-  Also a distributed database or ledger that is shared among the nodes of a computer network.

KEY TAKEAWAYS

- Blockchain is a type of shared database that differs from a typical database in the way that 
it stores information; blockchains store data in blocks that are then linked together via cryptography.

- As new data comes in, it is entered into a fresh block. Once the block is filled with data, it is chained 
onto the previous block, which makes the data chained together in chronological order.

- Different types of information can be stored on a blockchain, but the most common use so far has been as 
a ledger for transactions. 

- In Bitcoin’s case, blockchain is used in a decentralized way so that no single person or group has 
control —rather, all users collectively retain control.

- Decentralized blockchains are immutable, which means that the data entered is irreversible. For Bitcoin, 
this means that transactions are permanently recorded and viewable to anyone.
