Blockchain

- A blockchain in the most basic form is an audible database(a backend for storing information 
or transactions). It can be regarded as a database in which data can only be added on.

- It is a system in which a record of transactions made in bitcoin or another cryptocurrency are 
maintained across several computers that are linked in a peer-to-peer network.
